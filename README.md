# Video_glitch
Sorts columns by frame's average brightness in videos.

Input full path to directory where your video is saved to the path.txt file. Then input video name when programs prompts for it. If you use linux then change \\ symbols in video_processing to /. It takes some time to process frames and is very power hungry.
